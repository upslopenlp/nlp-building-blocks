# NLP Building Blocks

A set of microservices built around Apache OpenNLP. They can be used as-is but were primarily created to be examples.

The microservices provide NLP capabilities of language detection, named-entity recognition, sentence detection, and tokenization. Each is built using Spring Boot and features a simple REST-like API. Refer to the `README.md` file for each microservice for more information about it.
